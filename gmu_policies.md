### Course flexibility
We reserve the right to make changes to the syllabus for the sake of improving the course or accomodating the schedule of external speakers. Students will be given ample notice regarding any major changes to the course plan.

### Late Policy
We will deduct points for late assignments. Details are outlined in the grading rubric for each assignment.

### Communication
Students must use their Mason email account to receive important University information, including communications related to this class. We will not respond to messages sent from or send messages to a non-Mason email address on matters relating to this class.

### Campus Closure or Emergency Class Cancelation/Adjustment Policy
If a class meeting needs to be canceled or adjusted due to weather or other concern, students should check their emails for updates on how to continue learning and for information about any changes to events or assignments.

### Disability Accomodations
Disability Services at George Mason University is committed to upholding the letter and spirit of the laws that ensure equal treatment of people with disabilities. Under the administration of University Life, Disability Services implements and coordinates reasonable accommodations and disability-related services that afford equal access to university programs and activities. Students can begin the registration process with Disability Services at any time during their enrollment at George Mason University. If you are seeking accommodations, please visit http://ds.gmu.edu/ for detailed information about the Disability Services registration process. Disability Services is located in Student Union Building I (SUB I), Suite 2500. Email:ods@gmu.edu; Phone: (703) 993-2474

### Names and Pronouns
If you wish, please share your name and gender pronouns with us and indicate how best to address you in class and via email. Ted uses he/him pronouns and prefers that you address him as "Ted" in all contexts. Meaghan uses she/her pronouns and prefers that you address her as "Meaghan" in all contexts.

### Academic Integrity
The integrity of the University community is affected by the individual choices made by each of us. Mason has an Honor Code with clear guidelines regarding academic integrity. Three fundamental and rather simple principles to follow at all times are that: (1) all work submitted be your own; (2) when using the work or ideas of others, including fellow students, give full credit through accurate citations; and (3) if you are uncertain about the ground rules on a particular assignment, ask for clarification. No grade is important enough to justify academic misconduct. Plagiarism means using the exact words, opinions, or factual information from another person without giving the person credit. Writers give credit through accepted documentation styles, such as parenthetical citation, footnotes, or endnotes. Paraphrased material must also be cited, using the appropriate format for this class. A simple listing of books or articles is not sufficient. Plagiarism is the equivalent of intellectual robbery and cannot be tolerated in the academic setting. If you have any doubts about what constitutes plagiarism, please see me.

### Notice of mandatory reporting of sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, and stalking
As "Non-Confidential Employees," we must report all disclosures of sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, and stalking to Mason's Title IX Coordinator per University Policy 1202. If you wish to speak with someone confidentially, please contact one of Mason's confidential resources, such as Student Support and Advocacy Center (SSAC) at 703-993-3686 or Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 703-993-2380. You may also seek assistance or support measures from Mason's Title IX Coordinator by calling 703-993-8730, or emailing titleix@gmu.edu.
