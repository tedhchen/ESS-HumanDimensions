## About

This is a undergraduate-level course on human-environment interactions with a focus on environmental governance and policy-making. In this course, we will look at how humans shape and are in turn shaped by the environment. In approaching this topic, we will emphasize taking a systems approach to understanding human-environment interactions as complex socioecological systems. The course is organized around hands-on learning, with considerable time and effort put toward individual and team-based production of policy and community engagement projects.
